5 Stages of Pen Testing:

Reconnaissance

Scanning

Gaining Access

Maintaining Access

Covering Tracks

Legal and ethical guidelines

### Tools to Explore (Start practicing):
Recon: whois, nslookup, theHarvester, recon-ng

Wireless attacks (Wi-Fi hacking with aircrack-ng)

Password cracking (hashcat, john)

Bypassing firewalls & antivirus

### Tools to Explore:
burpsuite

aircrack-ng

ettercap

wireshark (deep usage)

sqlmap

beef

msfvenom

## Stage 5: Advanced Topics & Real-World Practice
Goal: Work on real-world scenarios, develop custom exploits, and prepare for certs.

### Topics to Learn:
Custom payload development (Python, PowerShell)

Malware analysis basics

Steganography

Red teaming vs blue teaming

Threat emulation

### Certifications to Consider:
OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional)

eJPT (Junior Penetration Tester)

CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker)

### Ongoing Practice & Community
Goal: Keep learning, updating, and staying in touch with the cybersecurity community.

### Engage With:
Reddit: r/Kalilinux, r/netsec, r/HowToHack

GitHub: Follow pentesting repos

Conferences: DEF CON, Black Hat, Nullcon

### Keep Practicing:
Build your lab: Metasploitable, DVWA, OWASP Juice Shop

Follow CTFs (Capture The Flag) challenges

### Final Tips
Always use Kali ethicallyâ€”only test on systems you own or have permission to test.

Learn defensive techniques too (blue teaming helps you think like an attacker).

Combine Kali with other tools: Burp Suite Pro, Maltego, BloodHound, etc.

Stay updated: Kali Linux gets regular updates; use sudo apt update && upgrade.
